# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of common design patterns implemented in Pyyhon language. The goal is to provide a simples demonstration of how these patterns can be used in real-world scenarios.

## Design Patterns

### Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Command

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging the requests.

### Chain of Responsibility

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled.

### Strategy

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
